# Sudoku-game-solver--Mini-project-
This project is a C-based Sudoku Solver that uses backtracking to fill a 9×9 grid. It checks rows, columns, and 3×3 boxes to place valid numbers. The program takes user input, solves the puzzle recursively, and displays the completed Sudoku or reports if no solution exists.
